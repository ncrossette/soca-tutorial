# the following names are a temporary hack. The diffusion IO code uses the model
# interface and so assumes that the variable names are one of the existing soca
# variable names

# NOTE: all length scales are calculated as a Gaussian sigma.
# (not a Gaspari-Cohn cuttoff as is used by other parts of SABER)

# Vertical length scales are in units of number of levels. The default length is
# VT_MIN. At the surface the length is equal to the mixed layer depth, and
# linearly interpolates to VT_MIN at the bottom of the mixed layer. Values
# larger than VT_MAX ar clipped to VT_MAX
VT_MAX: 10
VT_MIN: 1.5

# Horizontal length scales are in units of meters. The scales are equal to
# HZ_ROSSBY_MULT time the local Rossby radius. Any values less than
# HZ_MIN_GRID_MULT times the local grid size are increased. Any values greater
# than HZ_MAX are clipped to HZ_MAX.
#
# Note  that these scales are a little larger than what we would normally use
# (for demonstration purpose only), in the real world you would probably want to
# use 1.0 for the *_MULT parameters
HZ_ROSSBY_MULT: 2
HZ_MAX: 300000
HZ_MIN_GRID_MULT: 2
